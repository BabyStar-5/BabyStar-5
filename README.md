# About Me

#### Hi, I’m a passionate Blockchain Developer with over 5 years of experience building decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and Web3 integrations across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and more.

### With a strong foundation in Solidity, JavaScript/TypeScript, and full-stack development, I specialize in creating secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain solutions — from token contracts and NFT platforms to complex DeFi systems and DAO infrastructures.

### I’ve worked on projects ranging from NFT marketplaces and staking platforms to cross-chain token bridges and play-to-earn games. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of blockchain ecosystems and user experience.

### I’m always eager to solve challenging problems and collaborate with innovative teams. Whether you're launching a Web3 startup, need to audit a smart contract, or want to integrate crypto payments into your app — I'm here to help.

### Let’s build the future of the internet together.
